1111.Soft blessed anicha flower, hail On whom I dote is softer still.
1112.You can't liken flowers by many eyed, To her bright eyes, O mind dismayed.
1113.The bamboo-shouldered has pearl-like smiles Fragrant breath and lance-like eyes.
1114.Lily droops down to ground and says I can't equal the jewelled-one's eyes.
1115.Anicha flower with stem she wears To her breaking waist sad-drum-blares!
1116.Stars are confused to know which is The moon and which is woman's face.
1117.Are there spots on the lady's face Just as in moon that changes phase?
1118.Like my lady's face if you shine All my love to you; hail O moon!
1119.Like the face of my flower-eyed one If you look, then shine alone O moon!
1120.The soft flower and the swan's down are Like nettles to the feet of the fair.
