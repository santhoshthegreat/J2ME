1281.Rapture at thought and joy when seen Belong to love and not to wine.
1282.When passion grows palmyra-tall Sulking is wrong though millet-small.
1283.Though slighting me he acts his will My restless eyes would see him still.
1284.Huff I would, maid, but I forget; And leap to embrace him direct.
1285.When close I see not lord's blemish Like eyes that see not painter's brush.
1286.When he's with me I see not fault And nought but fault when he is not.
1287.To leap in stream which carries off When lord is close to feign a huff.
1288.Like wine to addicts that does disgrace Your breast, O thief, is for my embrace!
1289.Flower-soft is love; a few alone Know its delicacy so fine.
1290.She feigned dislike awhile but flew Faster for embrace than I do.
