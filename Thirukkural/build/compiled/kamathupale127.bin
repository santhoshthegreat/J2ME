1261.My eyes are dim lustre-bereft Worn fingers count days since he left.
1262.Beauty pales and my bracelets slide; Why not forget him now, bright maid?
1263.Will as guide he went to win Yet I live-to see him again.
1264.My heart in rapture heaves to see His retun with love to embrace me.
1265.Let me but gaze and gaze my spouse sallow on my soft shoulders files.
1266.Let my spouse return just a day Joy-drink shall drive my pain away.
1267.If my eye-like lord returneth Shall I sulk or clasp or do both?
1268.May the king fight and win and give And with my wife I will feast this eve!
1269.One day seems as seven to those Who yearn return of distant spouse.
1270.When her heart is broken, what is The good of meeting and love-embrace?
1271.
