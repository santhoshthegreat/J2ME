1181.My lover's parting, I allowed Whom to complain my hue pallid?
1182.Claiming it is begot through him Pallor creeps and rides over my frame.
1183.He seized my beauty and modesty Leaving pangs and Pallor to me.
1184.He is my thought, his praise my theme Yet this pallor steals over my frame.
1185.My lover departed me there And pallor usurped my body here.
1186.Just as darkness waits for light-off Pallor looks for lover's arms-off.
1187.From his embrace I turned a nonce This pallor swallowed me at once.
1188.On my pallor they cast a slur But none says "lo he parted her".
1189.Let all my body become pale If he who took my leave fares well.
1190.Let people call me all pallid But my lover let them not deride.
1191.
