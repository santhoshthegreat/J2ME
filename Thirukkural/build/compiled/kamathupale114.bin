1131.Pangs of passion find no recourse Except riding *`palmyra horse'.* Palmyra horse or 'Madal' is a torture expressive of the burning passion of the lover to the beloved.The lover's body is laid on a rough pricking palmyra bed and he is carried along the street with songs of love pangs. The parents of the lovers first  reproach them and then consent to their marriage.
1132.Pining body and mind lose shame And take to riding of the palm.
1133.Once I was modest and manly My love has now Madal only.
1134.Rushing flood of love sweeps away The raft of shame and firmness, aye!
1135.Palm-ride and pangs of eventide Are gifts of wreath-like bracelet maid.
1136.Madal I ride at midnight for My eyes sleep not seeing this fair.
1137.Her sea-like lust seeks not Madal! Serene is woman's self control.
1138.Lust betrays itself in haste Though women are highly soft and chaste.
1139.My perplexed love roves public street Believing that none knows its secret.
1140.Fools laugh at me before my eyes For they feel not my pangs and sighs.
