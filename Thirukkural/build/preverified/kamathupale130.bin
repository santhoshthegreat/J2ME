1291.You see, his heart is his alone; Why not my heart be all my own?
1292.O heart, you see how he slights me Yet you clasp him as if friendly.
1293.You follow him at will. Is it "The fallen have no friends" my heart?
1294.You won't sulk first and then submit Who will then consult you, my heart?
1295.Frets to gain and fears loss in gain O my heart suffers ceaseless pain.
1296.My itching mind eats me anon As I muse on him all alone.
1297.I forget shame but not his thought In mean foolish mind I'm caught.
1298.My heart living in love of him Hails his glory ignoring blame.
1299.Who support a man in grief If lover's heart denies relief?
1300.Why wonder if strangers disown When one's own heart is not his own?
1301.
