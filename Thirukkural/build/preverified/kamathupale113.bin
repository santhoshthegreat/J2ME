1121.Like milk and honey the dew is sweet From her white teeth whose word is soft.
1122.Love between me and this lady Is like bond between soul and body.
1123.Depart image in my pupil Giving room to my fair-browed belle!
1124.Life with my jewel is existence Death it is her severance.
1125.Can I forget? I recall always The charms of her bright battling eyes.
1126.So subtle is my lover's form Ever in my eyes winking, no harm.
1127.My lover in my eyes abides I paint them not lest he hides.
1128.My lover abides in my heart I fear hot food lest he feels hot.
1129.My eyes wink not lest he should hide And him as cruel the townsmen chide.
1130.He abides happy in my heart But people mistake he is apart.
1131.
