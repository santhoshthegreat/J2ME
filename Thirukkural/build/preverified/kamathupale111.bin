1101.In this bangled beauty dwell The joys of sight sound touch taste smell.
1102.The cure for ailment is somewhere For fair maid's ill she is the cure.
1103.Is lotus-eyed lord's heaven so sweet As sleep in lover's arms so soft?
1104.Away it burns and cools anear Wherefrom did she get this fire?
1105.The arms of my flower-tressed maid Whatever I wish that that accord.
1106.My simple maid has nectar arms Each embrace brings life-thrilling charms.
1107.Ah the embrace of this fair dameIs like sharing one's food at home.
1108.Joy is the fast embrace that doth Not admit e'en air between both.
1109.Sulking, feeling and clasping fast These three are sweets of lover's tryst.
1110.As knowledge reveals past ignorance So is the belle as love gets close.
