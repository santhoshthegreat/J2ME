1271.You hide; but your painted eyes Restraint off, report your surmise.
1272.With seemly grace and stem-like arms The simple she has ample charms.
1273.Something shines through her jewelled charm Like thread shining through wreathed gem.
1274.Like scent in bud secrets conceal In the bosom of her half smile.
1275.The close-bangled belle's hidden thought Has a cure for my troubled heart.
1276.His over-kind close embrace sooths; But makes me feel, loveless, he parts.
1277.Quick, my bracelets read before The mind of my lord of cool shore.
1278.My lover parted but yesterday; With sallowness it is seventh day.
1279.She views her armlets, her tender arms And then her feet; these are her norms.
1280.To express love-pangs by eyes and pray Is womanhood's womanly way.
