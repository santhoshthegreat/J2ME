1321.He is flawless; but I do pout. So that his loving ways show out.
1322.Fading first, love blooms and outlives The petty pricks that pouting gives.
1323.Is there a heaven like sulk beneath Of hearts that join like water and earth?
1324.In long pout after embrace sweet A weapon is up to break my heart.
1325.Though free form faults, one feels the charms Of feigned release from lover's arms.
1326.Sweeter than meal is digestion And sulk in love than union.
1327.The yielder wins in lover's pout Reunited joy brings it out.
1328.Shall not our pouting again give The dew-browed joy of joint love?
1329.Sulk on O belle of shining jewels! Prolong O night! our delight swells!
1330.Bouderie is lovers' delight Its delight grows when they unite.
