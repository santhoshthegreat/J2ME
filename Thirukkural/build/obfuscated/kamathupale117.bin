1161.It swells out like baled out spring How to bear this pain so writhing?
1162.I can't conceal this nor complain For shame to him who caused this pain.
1163.In life - poles of this wearied frame Are poised the weights of lust and shame.
1164.My lust is a sea; I do not see A raft to go across safely.
1165.What wilt they prove when they are foes Who in friendship bring me woes!
1166.The pleasure in love is oceanful But its pangs are more painful.
1167.Wild waves of love I swim shoreless Pining alone in midnight hush.
1168.Night's mercy lulls all souls to sleep Keeping but me for companionship.
1169.Crueller than that cruel he Are midnight hours gliding slowly.
1170.Like heart, if my sight reaches him It won't in floods of tears swim!
1171.
