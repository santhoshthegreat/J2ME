0771.Stand not before my chief, O foes! Many who stood, in stones repose
0772.To lift a lance that missed a tusker Is prouder than shaft that hit a hare.
0773.Valour is fight with fierce courage Mercy to the fallen is its edge.
0774.At the tusker he flings his lance One in body smiles another chance.
0775.When lances dart if heroes wink "It is a rout" the world will think.
0776.The brave shall deem the days as vain Which did not battle-wounds sustain.
0777.Their anklets aloud jingle their name Who sacrifice their life for fame.
0778.The king may chide, they pursue strife; They fear loss of glory; not life.
0779.Who will blame the heroes that lose Their lives in war to keep their vows?
0780.Such a death shall be prayed for Which draws the the tears of the ruler.
