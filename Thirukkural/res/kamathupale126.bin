1251.Passion's axe shall break the door Of reserve bolted with my honour.
1252.The thing called lust is a heartless power It sways my mind at midnight hour.
1253.How to hide this lust which shows Itself while I sneeze unawares!
1254.I was proud of my sex-reserve Lo lust betrays what I preserve.
1255.Dignity seeks not a deserter But Love-sick is its innovator.
1256.O Grief, my deserter you seek Of your caprice what shall I speak!
1257.When lover's love does what it desires We forget all shame unawares.
1258.The cheater of many wily arts His tempting words break through women's hearts.
1259.In huff I went and felt at ease Heat to heart in sweet embrace.
1260.To feign dislike is it not rare For mates who melt like fat in fire?
1261.
