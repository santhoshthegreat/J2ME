1202.Pains are off at the lover's thought In all aspects this love is sweet.
1203.To sneeze I tried hence but could not Me he tried to think but did not.
1204.Have I a place within his heart? Ah from mine he will never depart.

1206.Beyond the thought of life with him What else of life can I presume?
1207.What will happen if I forget When his memory burns my heart?
1208.I bring him to ceaseless memory He chides not; and thus honours me.
1209.Dear life ebbs away by thought Of him who said we are one heart.
1210.Hail moon! Set not so that I find Him who left me but not my mind.
