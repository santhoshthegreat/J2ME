0821.The friendship by an enemy shown Is anvil in time, to strike you down.
0822.Who pretend kinship but are not Their friendship's fickle like woman's heart.
0823.They may be vast in good studies But heartfelt-love is hard for foes.
0824.Fear foes whose face has winning smiles Whose heart is full of cunning guiles.
0825.Do not trust in what they tell Whose mind with your mind goes ill.
0826.The words of foes is quickly seen Though they speak like friends in fine.
0827.Trust not the humble words of foes Danger darts from bending bows.
0828.Adoring hands of foes hide arms Their sobbing tears have lurking harms.
0829. In open who praise, at heart despise Cajole and crush them in friendly guise.
0830.When foes, in time, play friendship's part Feign love on face but not in heart.
