1081.Is it an angel? A fair peacock Or jewelled belle? To my mind a shock!
1082.The counter glances of this belle Are armied dart of the Love-Angel.
1083.Not known before - I spy Demise In woman's guise with battling eyes.
1084.This artless dame has darting eyes That drink the life of men who gaze.
1085.Is it death, eye or doe? All three In winsome woman's look I see.
1086.If cruel brows unbent, would screen Her eyes won't cause me trembling pain.
1087.Vest on the buxom breast of her Looks like rutting tusker's eye-cover.
1088.Ah these fair brows shatter my might Feared by foemen yet to meet.
1089.Which jewel can add to her beauty With fawn-like looks and modesty?
1090.To the drunk alone is wine delight Nothing delights like love at sight.
