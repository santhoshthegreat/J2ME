1221.Bless you! you are not eventide But killing dart to wedded bride!
1222.Hail sad eventide dim and grim Has your mate like mine, cruel whim!
1223.Wet eve came pale and trembling then Now it makes bold with growing pain.
1224.Lover away, comes eventide Like slayer to field of homicide.
1225.What good have I done to morning And what evil to this evening?
1226.Evening pangs I have not known When my lord nev'r left me alone.
1227.Budding at dawn burgeoning all day This disease blooms in evening gay.
1228.A deadly arm, this shepherd's flute Hails flaming eve and slays my heart.
1229.Deluding eve if it prolongs The whole town will suffer love-pangs.
1230.Thinking of him whose quest is wealth My life outlives the twilight stealth.
1231.
