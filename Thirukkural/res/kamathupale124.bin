1231.To lift from want he left me afar His thought makes my eyes blush the flower.
1232.My pale tearful eyes betray The hardness of my husband, away.
1233.These arms that swelled on nuptial day Now shrunk proclaim "He is away".
1234.Bracelets slip off the arms that have Lost old beauty for He took leave.
1235.Bereft of bracelets and old beauty Arms tell the cruel's cruelty.
1236.Arms thin, armlets loose make you call My sire cruel; that pains my soul.
1237.Go and tell the cruel, O mind Bruit ov'r my arms and glory find.
1238.The front of this fair one O paled As my clasping arms loosed their hold.
1239.Cool breeze crept between our embrace Her large rain-cloud-eyes paled at once.
1240.Pale eyes pained seeing the pallor Of the bright forehead of this fair.
1241.
