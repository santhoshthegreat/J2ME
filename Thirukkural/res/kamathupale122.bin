1211.How shall I feast this dream-vision That brings the beloved's love-mission?
1212.I beg these fish-like dark eyes sleep To tell my lover how life I keep.
1213.In wakeful hours who sees me not I meet in dreams and linger yet.
1214.In dreams I enjoy his love-bliss Who in wakeful hours I miss.
1215.Dream-sight of him delights at once Awake- What of seeing him -hence.
1216.If wakeful hours come to nought My lov'r in dreams would nev'r depart.
1217.Awake he throws my overtures Adream, ah cruel! he tortures!
1218.Asleep he embraces me fast; Awake he enters quick my heart.
1219. In dreams who don't discern lovers Rue their missing in wakeful hours.
1220.The townsmen say he left me thus In dreams failing to see him close.
1221.
