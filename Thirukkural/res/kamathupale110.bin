1091.Her painted eyes, two glances dart One hurts; the other heals my heart.
1092.Her furtive lightning glance is more Than enjoyment of sexual lore.
1093.She looked; looking bowed her head And love-plant was with water fed.
1094.I look; she droops to earth awhile I turn; she looks with gentle smile.
1095.No direct gaze; a side-long glance She darts at me and smiles askance.
1096.Their words at first seem an offence But quick we feel them friendly ones.
1097.Harsh little words; offended looks, Are feigned consenting love-lorn tricks.
1098.What a grace the slim maid has! As I look she slightly smiles.
1099.Between lovers we do discern A stranger's look of unconcern.
1100.The words of mouth are of no use When eye to eye agrees the gaze.
