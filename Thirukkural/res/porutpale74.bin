0732.The Land has large luring treasure Where pests are nil and yields are sure.
0733.It's land that bears pressing burdens And pays its tax which king demands.
0734.It is country which is free from Fierce famine, plague and foemen's harm.

0736.The land of lands no ruin knows Even in grief its wealth yet grows.
0737.Waters up and down, hills and streams With strong forts as limbs country beams.
0738.Rich yield, delight, defence and wealth Are jewels of lands with blooming health.

0740.Though a land has thus every thing It is worthless without a king.
