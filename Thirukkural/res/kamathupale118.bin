1171.The eye pointed him to me; why then They weep with malady and pine?
1172.Why should these dyed eyes grieve now sans Regrets for their thoughtless glance?
1173.Eyes darted eager glance that day It's funny that they weep today.
1174.These eyes left me to endless grief Crying adry without relief.
1175.My eyes causing lust more than sea Suffer that torture sleeplessly.
1176.Lo! eyes that wrought this love-sickness Are victims of the same themselves.
1177.Let tears dry up pining pining In eyes that eyed him longing longing.
1178.Ther's he whose lips loved, not his heart Yet my eyes pine seeing him not.
1179.He comes; no sleep; he goes; no sleep This is the fate of eyes that weep.
1180.Like drum beats eyes declare my heart; From people who could hide his secret?
