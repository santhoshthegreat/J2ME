1241.Think of, O heart, some remedy To cure this chronic malady.
1242.Bless O mind! you pine in vain For me he has no love serene.
1243.O mind, why pine and sit moody? Who made you so pale lacks pity.
1244.Take these eyes and meet him, O heart Or their hunger will eat me out.
1245.He spurns our love and yet, O mind, Can we desert him as unkind?
1246.Wrath is false, O heart, face-to face. Sans huff, you rush to his sweet embrace.
1247.Off with love O mind, or shame I cannot endure both of them.
1248.Without pity he would depart! You sigh and seek his favour, poor heart!
1249.The lover lives in Self you know; Whom you think, mind to whom you go?
1250.Without a thought he deserted us To think of him will make us worse.
